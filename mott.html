I am honoured to be the Principal of this institution and I extend my heartiest thanks to the management forproviding me an opportunity to serve the school for the larger benefits and greater advantages of the young students of this area with zeal and enthusiasm. The parents, teachers and studentswork together for the betterment of the school.The students are obedient, smart and intelligentand enthusiastic to learn. The students come from a wide variety of environments. The school caters to the educational needs ofstudents from about 35 km radius.  Though  they come from such varied cultures they become a family once reaching the school.  We impart education into  these young minds with love and care. To give our students an international exposure we have tied up with the British Council. Our students  are doing projects in collaboration withschools in many foreign countries. We are committed to generate emotionally and socially responsible  citizens. The School management is the backbone of the institution
that fulfills all  requirements of the school in time. With the continued support of themanagement,parents, teachers and students we hope to achieve the desired goal.<br>
